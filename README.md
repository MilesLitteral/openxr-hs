# openxr-hs
An OpenXR 1.0 Specification Adaptation for Haskell

TODO:
  * define function bodies of library
  * bind appropriate types from other libraries (vulkan, opengl, etc) for binding functions to work correctly with those renderers
  * bind to a C library (write a Binding.hsc file, compile with an openxr.h and .o/.a of somekind)
